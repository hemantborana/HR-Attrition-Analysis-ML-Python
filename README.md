# HR Employee Attrition Analysis - Machine Learning Project

A comprehensive data science project analyzing employee attrition patterns using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project examines HR employee data to identify key factors contributing to employee attrition and develops predictive models for workforce retention. The analysis provides insights into job satisfaction, compensation patterns, and employee retention across different demographics and job roles.

## Dataset

- **Records**: 1,470 employees
- **Features**: 35 attributes including demographics, job metrics, and satisfaction scores
- **Target Variable**: Employee Attrition (Yes/No)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas & NumPy for data analysis
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analyses

1. **Monthly Income and Job Satisfaction** - Analysis by job role and education field
2. **Gender-Based Satisfaction Metrics** - Satisfaction patterns across roles and genders
3. **Compensation Analysis** - Hourly rates, income, and satisfaction by education and role
4. **Departmental Satisfaction** - Job satisfaction patterns by department and gender
5. **Distance from Home Impact** - Geographic proximity analysis
6. **Attrition Income Patterns** - Income comparison between retained and departed employees

## Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Performance**: 100% accuracy on test set
- **Features**: 67 engineered features after preprocessing
- **Data Processing**: StandardScaler normalization, one-hot encoding for categorical variables

## Key Findings

- Sales Representatives and Research Scientists show higher job satisfaction levels
- Significant income disparities exist across education levels and departments
- Income level, job role, and satisfaction metrics strongly predict attrition
- Notable gender-based variations in environment satisfaction across roles
- Distance from home correlates with job satisfaction in specific roles


## Academic Context

Completed as part of BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) - Semester 4, Amity University Online, under the TCS Course.
